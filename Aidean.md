Today, I would like to talk about a couple of key aspects to add to your scratch project.   
1. Varibles are extremely important when you make your project, as it grants you the abilaty to set more coundishtion then it is giving to you.  
2. Animation is important to make your game more appling to the user, as it gives actions more impact.
3. Utilization of the if-else blocks are important. Those will be what make up a lot of the code as it's what allows you to set the most basic condition and foundation for your game.

Heres key example to my game:
